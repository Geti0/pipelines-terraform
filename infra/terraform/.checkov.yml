  - CKV_AWS_55  # Ignore public ACLs
  - CKV_AWS_56  # Restrict public buckets
  - CKV_AWS_70  # Allow any principal (needed for public website)
  
  # CloudFront - educational assignment doesn't need enterprise features
  - CKV_AWS_86  # Access logging (adds costs)
  - CKV_AWS_310 # Origin failover (complex setup)
  - CKV_AWS_374 # Geo restriction (not needed for assignment)
  - CKV_AWS_68  # WAF (adds costs and complexity)
  
  # Lambda - educational assignment limitations  
  - CKV_AWS_117 # VPC configuration (complex networking setup)
  - CKV_AWS_272 # Code signing (enterprise feature)
